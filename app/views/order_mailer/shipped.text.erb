Hello <%= @order.billing_address.first_name %>,

Joy is just around the corner.

Your box of handcrafted goodies left the building today via <%= @order.shipping_option %><% if @order.estimated_delivery_date? %> and should get to you by <%= @order.estimated_delivery_date %><% end %>.

<%- if @order.tracking_number? -%>You can monitor your package’s whereabouts anytime you like using this tracking number: <%= @order.tracking_number %>.
<%- end -%>
Here’s a reminder of what you’re getting:

Order number #<%= @order.number %>, placed on <%= @order.purchased_at.stamp(configatron.date_formats.invoice) %>:

<% @order.line_items.each do |line_item| %>
<%= line_item.name.html_safe %> - <%= line_item.quantity %> x <%= line_item.price_each %> = <%= line_item.price %>
<% end %>

We're shipping to:
<%= @order.shipping_address.first_name %> <%= @order.shipping_address.last_name %>
<%= @order.shipping_address.address_1 %> <%= @order.shipping_address.address_2 %>
<%= @order.shipping_address.city %>, <%= @order.shipping_address.state %> <%= @order.shipping_address.postal_code %>
