  In order to decide which Chipp'd products I want
  As a potential customer
  I want to view product pages

  # Scenario: Viewing products
  #   Given a product with images exists
  #   When I go to the store product's page
  #   Then I should see the product name, description, and price

  # Scenario: Adding to cart
  #   Given a product named "Bracelet" that costs "12.99"
  #   When I go to the store product page
  #   And I add that product to my cart
  #   Then I should be at my cart
